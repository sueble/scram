Technical Issues
----------------

.. note:: The following list contains
          non-critical or questionable
          low-level technical issues.

- core::Gate and mef::Formula have ``type`` field instead of ``operator`` (reserved in C++)
- Static variables of class type with dynamic initialization.
- Performance profile across platforms is not stable.
- Builds are very demanding for the project size:
  500 MiB/job memory and 3 min total time.
  The major contributing factors may be
  the template-heavy code
  and coupled physical layout of the project components.
- Test coverage instruments fail to tally some inline functions and function templates
  (gcc/gcov no-inline limitations).
